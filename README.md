# Toss N' Wash

### Something
This is game was made by [Jessie](https://github.com/JurassicJessie "3D Modeler") 
and I, where Jessie was the 3D Modeler, and I was/is/something the programmer.
I used the game engine Unity 2017.4.18f1. The code is in C#.
I've decided to put all of the code and stuff on here, so someone who is learning to build a game from scratch, you can see how I approached it. Keep in mind, this was done in 2 days. I tried to stick to SOLID and best practices as much as I could.

### About
This was made during the  [Extra Credits Game Jam #3](https://itch.io/jam/extra-credits-game-jam-3 "FR33 GAM3").
Sadly, it was finished about ~30 minutes after the deadline, so it was never submitted.
The theme is cycles and a washing machine was the first to come to mind. So I went with that. Want some lore? Well, this takes place across the Golden Gate bridge, where some random rich person, who owns pretty much all of that land of Sausalito, needs to put random items in his laundry machine. He loves numbers, especially prime numbers, so he gets a score for putting in random items in his washing machine.

### Instructions
You hold key 'z' down to initially get an item, and then to throw the item, you fling your mouse in some random direction (preferably to the direction of the washing machine) and let go of key 'z' to release the item. You can click and hold the left mouse button instead of holding key 'z', but it was found easier to fling the mouse and hit a key on the keyboard than using the mouse and click-hold according to the Toss N' Wash Game Design Of Absolute Greatness Consensus Bureau To The Max, otherwise famously known as [TNWGDOAGCBTTM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9ixvD0_CmM "TNETENNBA").


### Assets used
I use Unity Camera Asset, CCTV, to follow the mouse movement smoothly. For level transitions between scenes, I used the tutorial [Makin' Stuff Look Good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnAoD7hgDxw). You can check out how I connected it into the game in the [TransitionsManager](https://github.com/TheDrw/WashingMachineGameJam/tree/master/WashingMachineGameJam/Assets/Camera). I used a free skybox asset from [Boxophobic](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/20529). The font is [BradBunR](https://github.com/TheDrw/WashingMachineGameJam/tree/master/WashingMachineGameJam/Assets/Core/Font). And that's all I think at the moment.

### License Stuff
Not sure what to put here, but you can do whatever you want with the game. You just have to credit me in some way you see fit.
